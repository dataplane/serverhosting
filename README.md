# Server Hosting Providers

This list is not a comprehensive list of hosting providers, only those
that DataPlane.org has recently utilized are included.  Therefore, by
definition, this is a woefully incomplete and imperfect list of server
hosting providers.

DataPlane.org utilizes server hosting providers for a variety of data,
feeds and measurement projects.  We generally use KVM-based virtual
servers or dedicated (bare metal) systems that can run the latest stable
version of Debian.  Our resource requirements are modest.  For example,
as of this writing, a sensor VM with 512MB of RAM, a 10GB disk, and the
equivalent of a shared 10 Mb/s link is more than enough.  The ability to
remotely reboot and re-install a minimal, relatively current Debian
amd64 (x86_64) system without support intervention is highly desirable.
Geographic diversity and a diverse set of IP address assignments across
our sensor nodes is of particular interest and sometimes drives our
interest in certain providers.  With very few exceptions, PayPal billing
is the payment method of choice.  We are happy to provide complete
contact information and even voice verification, but with very rare
exception we do not do business with providers that request copies or
scans of a personnel's government-issued identification or a billing
statement.

Brief notes or comments about a server hosting provider based on
DataPlane.org's experience with them may be included.  Only factual or
reasonably objective statements will be made about each provider listed
here.

This list makes no endorsement for nor seeks to malign any specific
provider.  Rather, this list is simply a public record and accounting of
some DataPlane.org activities.

**Note to server hosting providers:** You may not be listed here simply
because we are not aware of you.  You may also not be listed here,
because we are aware of you and could not justify utilizing your
services.
