# Server Hosting Providers

This list is not a comprehensive list of hosting providers, only those
that Dataplane.org has recently utilized are included.  Therefore, by
definition, this is a woefully incomplete and imperfect list of server
hosting providers.

Dataplane.org utilizes server hosting providers for a variety of system,
signal, measurement, and analysis projects.  We generally use KVM-based
virtual servers or dedicated (bare metal) systems that can run the
latest stable version of Debian.  Our resource requirements are modest.
For example, as of this writing, a vantage point VM with 512MB of RAM,
10GB of local disk storage, at least one public IPv4 address, a public
IPv6 address/prefix assignment, unfettered ingress protocol and
application access to the hosted system, and the equivalent of a shared
10 Mb/s link is sufficient.  The ability to remotely reboot and
re-install the OS without support intervention is highly desirable.
Geographic and topological network diversity across our vantage points
is of particular interest and sometimes drives our interest in certain
providers.  With very few exceptions, PayPal billing is the payment
method of choice.  We are happy to provide complete contact information
and even voice verification, but with very rare exception we do not do
business with providers that request copies or scans of a private
government-issued identification or billing statement.

Provider provisioning can vary widely.  For example, some providers do
not provide IPv6 addressing in the base build, but will supply an
assignment if you ask for it.  Similarly, some providers block certain
protocols or applications by default, but will remove restrictions if
asked and justified.

Brief notes or comments about a server hosting provider based on
Dataplane.org's experience with them may be included.  Only factual or
reasonably objective statements will be made about each provider listed
here.

This list makes no endorsement for nor seeks to malign any specific
provider.  Rather, this list is simply a public record and accounting of
some Dataplane.org activities.

**Note to server hosting providers:** You may not be listed here simply
because we are not aware of you.  You may also not be listed here,
because we are aware of you and could not justify utilizing your
services.
